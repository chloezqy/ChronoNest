# ChronoNest — Smart Scheduling for a World Running on Empty

ChronoNest reimagines productivity tools by optimizing for **energy**, not just time.
It helps students and knowledge workers plan days that balance diligence and recovery through adaptive modes, predictive rest, and an AI-assisted Auto-Pilot scheduler.

## Core Screens

1. **Active / Focus Mode** – Displays current schedule, progress cards, and energy states.
2. **Auto-Pilot Mode** – Automatically rearranges tasks based on predicted energy and priority.
3. **Inactive Mode** – Visualizes energy recovery with mood chart and rest categories.
4. **Add Task** – Create new events with editable title, category, and focus level.
5. **Expanded Calendar View** – See a full-day timeline with color-coded tasks.
6. **Profile** – Manage sync options and energy insights.

## How It Works

* UI/UX design in **Figma**.
* Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Vite**.
